## Visual Vibe Instructions for Cursor

1. **Background Aura**:
   - Use a radial gradient with a sunburst-like glow.
   - Center: white (`#FFFFFF`) or background base `#FDFFFD`.
   - Outer: blend warm yellow-orange hues (#FFD05B to #F27E00), softened with a noise texture overlay.
   - Optional blend with Primary/100 (`#C8EEC8`) for a subtle QuickReply brand anchor.

2. **Main Typography**:
   - Font Family: Inter (as per QuickReply style guide)
   - Headline Font Size: 80px on desktop (H1 from style guide), 40px on mobile
   - Subheadline: Subtitle (20px), weight medium or semibold
   - Emphasize "Click-to-Instagram" and "Convert" with darker Grey/900 for punch

3. **Structure**:
   - Central vertical alignment
   - Generous top and bottom margin spacing to create breathing space
   - CTA buttons grouped with clear visual hierarchy, stacked on mobile

   - Subheadline: fade-in with 100ms delay
   - CTA: subtle scale + glow on hover (using Primary/500 and Primary/700)
   - Badge float-in: upward ease-in with 300ms delay

5. **Visual Character**:
   - Confident, warm, high-trust B2B tone
