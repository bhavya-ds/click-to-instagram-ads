## Design Principles (Hybrid Approach)

### Contrast & Hierarchy (QuickReply + Challenger Attitude)
1. **Bold vs. Subtle:** Strong headlines in Primary green, lighter supporting text in Grey system
2. **Static vs. Dynamic:** Visual representation using QuickReply cards with contrasting treatments
3. **Corporate vs. Personal:** Forms feel cold (Grey tones), conversations feel human (Primary green accents)

### Instagram Native Feel (Within QuickReply Framework)
- Use IG's familiar interaction patterns within QuickReply card components
- Incorporate recognizable IG interface elements styled with QuickReply colors
- Mobile-first approach using QuickReply's clean, accessible design system
- Stories and feed aesthetic influences within brand guidelines

### Confident Challenger Attitude (QuickReply Brand Integrity)
- Bold use of Primary green (#4EC84E) for emphasis and CTAs
- Strategic use of whitespace following QuickReply spacing standards
- Make competitors' approach look outdated using muted Grey tones
- Position as insider solution using QuickReply's trusted, professional aesthetic

## Content Tone Integration
The visual design should reinforce the contrarian message using QuickReply's clean, professional framework: your competitors are stuck with boring forms (shown in muted greys) while you're having dynamic, converting conversations (highlighted in brand green) on the platform people actually use.

## Implementation Notes
- Use QuickReply's existing card components as building blocks
- Maintain brand consistency with Primary green as the hero color
- Introduce Instagram visual cues through content and imagery, not color overhaul
- Keep the challenger attitude through typography hierarchy and content treatment, not radical design departure
